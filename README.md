## What you get ##
  > Venshur allows you to import pictures from your Instagram account by simply indicating a hashtag you used for your trip, and then see your whole trip on a map based on locations of the pictures. It's like reliving your adventure all over again!

## Before Venshur ##
  > What you got after your oh-so-awaited vacation or weekend getaway, was just a bunch of pictures to remind you of your trip's highlights, with no rhyme or reason, simply laid out in a grid in chronological order. Bo-ring! 

## With Venshur ##
  > You can virtually recreate your adventure with a visual reminder for every cool or remarkable place you visited, making your memories so much more vivid and gratifying.

## From Mr. Harrison, our distinguished spokesperson: ##
  > "It's like memories on a map."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Step 1: Go on an adventure.
  > Step 2: Start posting pictures to your Instagram account - make sure to include a location and tag each photo with the same hashtag!
  > Step 3: Upon return from your trip, visit us at venshur.herokuapp.com, log in with your instagram credentials and map out your adventure by simply adding your hashtag!
